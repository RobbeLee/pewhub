This is a personal project of mine where I recreate YouTube with my own little twists in order to improve my skills on all fields of web development. _~~(+rep if you get the name)~~_

## Disclaimer
* This is still a work in progress, don't expect *~~everything~~* anything to work.
* Do not straight up copy code and then wonder why I doesn't work.
* Even though I do have quite some experience, I don't believe I'm anywhere near perfect so please excuse any bad programming and correct me on it.

## Features
You can make an account, upload videos, subscribe, see analytics, etc. I also want to make the wesbite very personalized by making the user choose a theme color and a light or dark theme. You can also customize your own channel much more then YouTube's.
